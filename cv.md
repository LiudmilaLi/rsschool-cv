My goal is to learn front-end development and to connect my further professional activities with this. I have a mathematical mindset and a great desire to learn, but at the same time I love creativity: to draw, to take photos and just look at beautiful things and visit various beautiful places. Also I like chatting and meeting new people, learning from their knowledge and experience, and at the same time sharing mine. I believe that all this will help me achieve the result.
